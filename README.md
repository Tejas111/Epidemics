# Epidemic Analysis
<br>
As stated by Charles Darwin, the motive of all organisms is to evolve and adapt to the surrounding environment. It is always survaival of the fittest. For humans to survive , it is necessary we take necessary precautions even before a disaster strikes , be it natural or man made .We propose to tackle the outbreaks of **epidemics** and it's adverse effects by predicting the possibility of an outbreak in the future and if there is a possibility , the extent to which it would affect life.

## What is an Epidemic?
Epidemic refers to rapid spread of potentially infectious disease to a large number of people in a given population within a 
short period of time which adds to the complexity of the epidemics.

## Proposed Idea:
We plan to use machine learning algorithms to predict the outbreak of epidemic diseases and determine its propagation by taking into account various factors such as number of people infected, climatic conditions ,time taken for symptoms to show up, rate of spread of infection , time taken for the infection to subside and other factors.Unfortunately , just as the human body grows immune to various viruses and bacteria, these organisms also grow immune to the antibiotics used in the past and the climatic conditions. Hence we need to consider the organism responsible for the outbreak too and it's past data. This would help the government to take necessary steps for prevention of outbreak by isolation of the infected masses or managing the after effects (if it's too late) by providing rapid medical aid to the potential victims to lower the death rate. This project aims at preventing further outbreak of epidemics by alerting people and government about the spread of diseases.
