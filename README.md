# Epidemic Analysis

## What is Epidemic?
Epidemic refers to rapid spread of potentially infectious disease to a large number of people in a given population within a 
short period of time which adds to the complexity of the epidemics.

## Idea:
We plan to use machine learning algorithms to predict the outbreak of epidemic diseases by taking in various inputs such as number people infected ,time taken and other factors.
