# Epidemic Analysis

## What is Epidemic?
Epidemic refers to rapid spread of potentially infectious disease to a large number of people in a given population within a 
short period of time which adds to the complexity of the epidemics.

## Idea:
We plan to use machine learning algorithms to predict the outbreak of epidemic diseases and determine its propogation by taking in various inputs such as number people infected ,time taken for infection to spread and other factors of different regions. This would help the
government to take serious steps like providing rapid medical aid so that the outbreak doesn't spread more. This project aims at preventing further outbreak of epidemics by alerting people and government about the spread of diseases.
